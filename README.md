### ***Description***

####  Second go at a personal website. I wanted to make this because feel like I haven't spent enough time understanding and working with CSS. I've heavily relied on CSS libraries and I wanted to build a web application that showcases my proficiency with pure CSS concepts. For the occasion I got into keyframe animations, shadow effects, and unusual css properties like `content`. It also features some nifty logic which I'm proud of, particularly rendering in the experiences section.
