### ***Description/ramblings***

####  Self explanatory, really. This is my portfolio. the very first in fact. Feels awesome to see the result of months of practice culminate into an actual professional portfolio. To celebrate, I finally decided to learn and implement TailwindsCSS. That was quite a fun experience. I also implemented email messaging using Emailjs. 

#### Usually not great at designing a sleek UI but I really applied myself for this. Dare I say, I feel proud?
